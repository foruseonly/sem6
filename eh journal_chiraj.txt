Aim:
Using Nmap scanner to perform port scanning of various 
forms – ACK, SYN, FIN, NULL, XMAS
Install Nmap for windows and install it. After that open cmd 
and type “nmap” to check if it is installed properly. Now type 
the below commands.
• ACK -sA (TCP ACK scan) 
It never determines open (or even open filtered) ports. It is 
used to map out firewall rulesets, determining whether they 
are stateful or not and which ports are filtered.
##Command: nmap -sA -T4 scanme.nmap.org##
• SYN (Stealth) Scan (-sS) 
SYN scan is the default and most popular scan option for 
good reason. It can be performed quickly, scanning thousands 
of ports per second on a fast network not hampered by 
intrusive firewalls. 
##Command: nmap -p22,113,139 scanme.nmap.org##
• FIN Scan (-sF) 
Sets just the TCP FIN bit. 
##Command: nmap -sF -T4 para##
• NULL Scan (-sN) 
Does not set any bits (TCP flag header is 0) 
##Command: nmap –sN –p 22 scanme.nmap.org##
• XMAS Scan (-sX) 
Sets the FIN, PSH, and URG flags, lighting the packet up like a 
Christmas tree. 
##Command: nmap -sX -T4 scanme.nmap.org##
